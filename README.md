# project_base
A simple project directory framework for bioinformatic analyses

## easy to set up
Clone this framework locally for easy organization and version management of your projects. Just rename the project_base folder, initialize, and start backing up your hard work.

## simple storage scheme
The "analysis' and 'data' folders will typically contain raw or intermediate files that exceed the storage capacity offered by github. Only files placed in the 'track' folder (such as summary statistics or diagrams) will be pushed to remote.
